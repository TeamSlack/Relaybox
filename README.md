Relay Control GUI for remote bench

Original
	- To automate some complex / repetitive tests which requires switching multiple input and measuring multiple outputs on DUT
	- Design of the interface was meant to be small and able to be dismantled & setup easily.
	- Design was meant to be controlled by means of remote - GUI will be needed.
	- Design was meant to have scripting feature for repetitive test.
	
New
	- Redefine the purpose of the interface 
		○ To facilitate oscilloscope measurements for signal lines?
		○ Automate more and more portion of repetitive tests
    Q current measurements - eg, want to measure 100x, want to measure overnight etc
